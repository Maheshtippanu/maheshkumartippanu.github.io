The journey from steel and structures to scripts and servers has been anything but ordinary. My name is Mahesh Kumar Tippanu, and I come from a traditional civil engineering background. Yet, today I find myself immersed in the world of computer science and technology, with one clear goal: to build a future in research and innovation in Luxembourg.

## 🔄 Why I Transitioned from Civil to IT

During my early years as a B.Tech civil engineering student, I was fascinated by the design and execution of infrastructure. But over time, I realized that the world is shifting toward digital transformation, and I didn’t want to be left behind. My interest in automation, data systems, and optimization gradually led me to explore computer science.

This curiosity was more than a phase. It drove me to pursue a Master’s of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering— a decision that changed my trajectory.

## 🧑‍🎓 The M.Tech Journey and Beyond

I recently completed my second semester of M.Tech with a CGPA of 8.0, and the learning has been transformative. I’ve immersed myself in topics like:

- System Administration and IT Infrastructure
- Computer Networking and Cybersecurity
- Data Science and Machine Learning
- Software Development using Python, Java, and .NET
- Research tools like EEG, E-Prime, and MATLAB

These experiences have helped me build not just technical skills but also a mindset of critical thinking, innovation, and collaboration — all crucial for research.

## 🎯 My Goal: Research in Luxembourg

While exploring European research ecosystems, Luxembourg stood out to me for its:

- Strong emphasis on interdisciplinary research
- Cutting-edge infrastructure and innovation hubs
- Welcoming environment for international researchers
- Growing focus on AI, behavioral science, and sustainability

My ultimate aim is to extend my thesis into a PhD, combining my civil engineering foundation with computing, possibly in smart infrastructure, human behavior in urban systems, or IT solutions for sustainable cities.

## 💼 Current Focus: Erasmus Behavioural Lab & Opportunities

Recently, I applied for the IT Specialist position at Erasmus Behavioural Lab in the Netherlands, as I see it as a gateway to collaborative behavioral research, sensor technology, and interdisciplinary exposure — exactly the kind of environment I aspire to be part of.

I'm also actively preparing a research proposal to align with universities in Luxembourg. My unique academic combination, combined with my passion and persistence, can contribute to real-world, data-driven research.

## 💬 Final Words

The path hasn’t been linear, but it’s been meaningful.

From construction sites to coding scripts, and structural blueprints to neural networks, I’ve redefined what it means to be an engineer. I hope this blog inspires others who wish to pivot their careers and chase what truly excites them.

📌 Luxembourg, I’m coming with vision, versatility, and a willingness to learn.
